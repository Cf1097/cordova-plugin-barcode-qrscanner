# cordova-plugin-qrscanner

A fast, energy efficient, highly-configurable QR code scanner for Cordova apps – available for the iOS, Android, Windows, and browser platforms.

QRScanner's native camera preview is rendered behind the Cordova app's webview, and QRScanner provides `show` and `hide` methods to toggle the transparency of the webview's background. This allows for a completely HTML/CSS/JS interface to be built inside the webview to control the scanner.
